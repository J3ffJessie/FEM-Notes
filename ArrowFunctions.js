// Shorthand way to save our Code 

// function multiplyBy2(input) { return input * 2 } full written block of declaritive function

// const multiplyBy2 = (input) => { return input * 2} breaking it down a little bit

// const multiplyBy2 = (input) => input * 2 breaking it down even further

const multiplyBy2 = input => input * 2 //strictly the core functionality as in a arrow function

const output = multiplyBy2(3) //6

console.log(output);


// Anonymous and Arrow Functions

// Improve immediate legibility of the code 
// But at least for our purposes here they are 'syntactic sugar' - we'll see their full effects later
// Understanding how they're working under the hood is vital to avoid confusion.
